# EOSmartUpdateClient
A smart updater client for EndlessOnline. It will update the client to the latest version, or download the latest version if run in an empty folder.

## Usage
Place the updater in your EndlessOnline folder or in an empty folder. Then simply launch the updater - it takes care of the rest. Any files missing or outdated in the folder will be updated by the updater. Your settings and chatlogs will be preserved unless you uncheck Preserve Settings and then click Force Update.

## Requirements
* Windows
* .NET 5.0 - available here: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/sdk-5.0.408-windows-x64-installer
